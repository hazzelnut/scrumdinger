# Scrumdinger

I'm following the iOS app dev tutorial [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training) in building a scrum organizing app.

The goal? To get a taste of iOS development and coding with Swift.

And, see what the development experience is like with SwiftUI.

So far, I quite like it. It reminds me a lot of web development in how it structures the UI layout.

Also learned about `@Binding` and `@State`. SwiftUI's way of managing state information across the different views.
Here's what it looks like:

Just started out following the tutorial. So far, I'm learning about stacks and views. Quite basic, and not super interesting.
