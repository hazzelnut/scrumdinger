# Scrumdinger

I'm following the iOS app dev tutorial [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training) in building a scrum organizing app.

The goal? To get a taste of iOS development and coding with Swift.

And, see what the development experience is like with SwiftUI.

So far, I quite like it. It reminds me a lot of web development in how it structures the UI layout.

Got `NavigationalViews` working. Now, a user can navigate to multiple views. In addition, we can also open up a 'modal' or a `.sheet` as it is called. In the app, that happens when we press on the 'Edit' button.

Also learned about `@Binding` and `@State`. SwiftUI's way of managing state information across the different views. Here, I'm using both property wrapper types to understand how 'state' values change. And how we can use new state values to update existing state values. 

Here's what all of it looks like so far:

Just started out following the tutorial. So far, I'm learning about stacks and views. Quite basic, and not super interesting.

Here's what I have so far:
