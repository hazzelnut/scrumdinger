# Scrumdinger

I'm following the iOS app dev tutorial [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training) in building a scrum organizing app.

The goal? To get a taste of iOS development and coding with Swift.

And, see what the development experience is like with SwiftUI.

So far, I quite like it. It reminds me a lot of web development in how it structures the UI layout.

### August 23, 2022 - Passing Data with Bindings

Wired up the app using `@Binding` and `@State` in order to pass data between views. Now the 'Edit' functionality works! 

Updating existing data is done by passing [*projectedValue*](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/projectedvalue) down the chain of views using the `${name_of_value}` syntax.

Defining `@State` in a struct creates a source of truth for a value type. To make modifications to that state value, we pass the value using the *`projectedValue`* syntax (ex. `${name_of_value}`) also known as 'passing a binding'. Depending on where that value is passed, a binding lets us share write access to that `@State` value in other views. And, we can use `@Binding` in a struct to declare a value with write access to a `@State` value in some other view.

For example, we have the parent view `DetailView.swift`:
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct DetailView: View {
  @State private var data = DailyScrum.Data() // Define source of truth
  ...
  List {
    ...
  }
  .sheet(...) // The 'Edit' modal
  NavigationView {
    DetailEditView(data: $data) // pass the projectedValue
  }
}
```
And in the child view `DetailEditView.swift`:
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct DetailEditView: View {
    @Binding var data: DailyScrum.Data // Reference to the 'data' @State value in DetailView
    ...
    Section(...) {
        ForEach(data.attendees) { attendee in
            Text(attendee.name)
        }
        .onDelete { indices in
            data.attendees.remove(atOffsets: indices)
        } // We modify the state value
    }
}
```

And this is what we have üéâ:


### August 22, 2022 - Navigating Between Views

Got `NavigationalViews` working. Now, a user can navigate to multiple views. In addition, we can also open up a 'modal' or a `.sheet` as it is called. In the app, that happens when we press on the 'Edit' button.

Also learned about `@Binding` and `@State`. SwiftUI's way of managing state information across the different views. Here, I'm using both property wrapper types to understand how 'state' values change. And how we can use new state values to update existing state values. 

Here's what all of it looks like so far:

***Fast forward by about a week ‚è±***

### August 16, 2022 - Stacks and Views

Just started out following the tutorial. So far, I'm learning about stacks and views. Quite basic, and not super interesting.

Here's what I have so far:
